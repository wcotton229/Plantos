      <h2>How to Set-up Watering Schedule</h2>
      <p>Specific watering requirements aren't usually given right away because it depends on where in the house (by a sunny
        window, in a corner) you place your plant and the humidity of your home. To figure this out...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Add a new plant.</li>
        <li>Water it the first time and push the WateredIt! button.</li>
        <li>Check the watering requirements. For example, if your palm needs "evenly moist soil, but never soggy," check it every
          day to see when it's no longer moist. Water it and click the WateredIt! button.</li>
        <li>Three to four clicks are enough to establish a pattern and then the app takes over in reminding you.</li>
      </ol>
